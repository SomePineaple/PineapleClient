Based off of wurstplustwo, https://github.com/TrvsF/wurstplus-two, I added a couple of things and renamed it to pineapleclient.
### How to install

It is reccomended that you build the client from source, as I have had crashing issues when I try the prebuild jar on other devices. For windows, click on https://youtu.be/1ANwvrSiquI for more info on building from source.
